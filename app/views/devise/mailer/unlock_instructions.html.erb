<h2>Account Security Alert</h2>

<p>Hello <%= @resource.full_name || @resource.email.split('@').first %>!</p>

<p>Your eLMo account has been temporarily locked due to multiple unsuccessful sign-in attempts. This is a security measure to protect your financial information and personal data.</p>

<div class="info-box">
  <p><strong>Why was my account locked?</strong> After several failed login attempts, we automatically lock accounts to prevent unauthorized access. This helps protect your sensitive financial information.</p>
</div>

<p>To unlock your account and regain access, click the button below:</p>

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">
  <%= link_to 'Unlock My Account', unlock_url(@resource, unlock_token: @token), class: 'cta-button' %>
</div>

<p>Once unlocked, you'll be able to sign in normally. If you continue to have trouble remembering your password, consider using the "Forgot Password" option to create a new one.</p>

<div class="alert-box">
  <p><strong>Having trouble?</strong> If the button doesn't work, copy and paste this link into your browser: <%= unlock_url(@resource, unlock_token: @token) %></p>
</div>
